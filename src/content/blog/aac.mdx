# Hosting a Next.js app on S3

Hosting a next.js site on vercel is great, I have been using it a lot but let’s face it; there are times when it’s just overkill.

I have recently rewrote the whole landingpage of Unditcat using next.js but when started testing it’s performance on vercel, I wasn’t completely satisfied. Even though everything was hardcoded in the app it took way longer to load than a regular JAMStack site, not to mention cold runs on vercel, which took over 2-3 seconds to load the site, which was unacceptable.

So I decided to switch to static site hosting, since I didn’t use any of next.js’ vercel-specific features anyway.

Using AWS S3 has several advanteges to vercel; not only it will be way faster, with proper caching using AWS Cloudfront, it’s just way more convinient if someone is already using AWS.

There are limitations of using S3 rather than Vercel, of course; since S3 is only a file storage, there is no way to utilise next’s SSR or ISG - all the files should be present at the time of uploading, not to mention middlewares, which won’t work either.

There are other great solutions, created specifically for static, jam-stack websites - such as astro or gatsby, all of which would be a better solution. I decided to go with next.js because of it’s developer experience - it’s one of the best I have ever used.

So, after playing around with next and S3, I decided to create a CLI tool to deploy any next.js site on S3 and configure everything on AWS for the site.

_TLDR; hosting a next.js app on S3 is not a reliable solution for everyone, however, it is a great option to host static sites - this site is hosted on S3 as well._

## Hosting a site on S3

### Configure AWS

Hosting any kind of static websites on AWS has a couple of prerequisits - there are lot’s of great tutorials on how to achieve this, so I will only give a breif list of all the things you will need to set up before hosting anything on S3.

1. **Create a bucket** - this is where your files will be stored
2. **Create the cloudfront distribution** - we will use cloudfront to cache our site
3. **Connect Route53** - so the site will be available under your domain

### Using the CLI

First install the package to your local machine:

```bash
npm i -g next-s3
```

After logging in to the AWS cli locally, we can configure the site to use the specific Bucket, Cloudfront Distribution and profile we created earlier.

One way of achieving this is by using a dotenv file:

```env
NEXT_S3_BUCKET = <name of the bucket>
NEXT_S3_DISTRIBUTION = <id of the cloudfront distribution>
NEXT_S3_PROFILE = <id of the profile to be used>
```

Apart from the name of the bucket, all the other options are optional, if you wish to handle cache invalidation yourself.

For the complete documentation and more options, check out the [package’s github repo](https://github.com/szalaybalazs/next-s3).

After everything is set up, you have no other job than to run the deploy command from the root directory of your project:

```bash
next-s3 deploy
```

Assuming everything is set up correctly, it might take between a few seconds and a couple of minutes to upload everything to S3, depending on the size of your project.

## How it all works

Uploading a simple JAM-stack site to S3 isn’t as easy as it should be - there are lot’s of small steps needed for a site to work as expected. So, here is a breakdown of what the package is doing, in case you would like to do it manually:

### 1. Exporting the site

Before we could even start uploading the site, first we need to export the next.js project. This often times has a couple of catches, such as when you are using next’s built-in image component.

Unfortunately, there is no automatic solutions for all the issues, usually it depends on the developer to come up with a solution for them.

For example, for the issue from above, you could start using some kind of other CDN - designed specifically for image hosting, which is a built-in feature in next.js, you just have to play with the configs a bit.

### 2. Uploading files

After everything is generated the next logical step is uploading all the files to S3, however, there is a small catch; there is no straight forward way to tell S3 to load html files without the extension - which means that we have to upload all the files without it’s extension, storing the file format and other cache settings in the file’s header.

This can be easily achieved by using the official node.js AWS sdk:

```ts
const uploadFile = async (file: string, bucket: string, s3: AWS.S3, bar: cliProgress.SingleBar): Promise<true> => {
  const content = fs.readFileSync(path.join(process.cwd(), file));
  const Key = file.replace('./out/', '');
  const params = {
    Bucket: bucket,
    Key,
    Body: content,
    ContentType: mime.lookup(file.split('.').pop() || file) as any,
    CacheControl: 'immutable,public',
  };

  await s3.upload(params).promise();

  if (file.endsWith('.html')) {
    const copyTarget = Key.replace(/\.html$/, '');
    const copyParams = {
      Bucket: bucket,
      CopySource: `/${bucket}/${Key}`,
      Key: copyTarget,
    };
    await s3.copyObject(copyParams).promise();
  }
  bar.increment(1);

  return true;
};
```

Sure, there is a huge room to optimise the code above, but it get’s the job done. It is used to upload everything from the `out` directory - excluding all the meta files, just as `DS_Store`.

After the file get’s uploaded to it’s desired destination, every HTML file get’s duplicated and renamed to it’s extension-less equivalent. This step doesn’t even require any kind of file upload, since everything happens straight on S3.

### 3. Configuring our bucket.

After uploading all the files for the first time we need to make sure that the bucket is configured correctly to be used for website hosting.

Although I am using node.js in the examples, all of these steps can be achieved using any of AWS’ clients.

1. **Configuring website hosting**
   We have to specify both the document returned in case of an error and also the index document.

```ts
const websiteParams = {
  Bucket: bucket,
  ContentMD5: '',
  WebsiteConfiguration: {
    ErrorDocument: {
      Key: '404.html',
    },
    IndexDocument: {
      Suffix: 'index.html',
    },
  },
};
await s3.putBucketWebsite(websiteParams).promise();
```

Since next.js always generates a `404.html` and an `index.html`, we can just simply hardcode these values.

2. **Configuring bucket access**
   We also have to tell S3 to allow public access to the bucket for anyone on the internet, so we can actually show the site.

```ts
const policyParams = {
  Bucket: bucket,
  PublicAccessBlockConfiguration: {
    BlockPublicAcls: false,
    BlockPublicPolicy: false,
    IgnorePublicAcls: false,
    RestrictPublicBuckets: false,
  },
};
await s3.putPublicAccessBlock(policyParams).promise();
```

4. **Configuring IAM policies**
   The last step in configuring the bucket is to allow allow access to the files using a Policy Statement. This is to further ensure everyone has **read** access to the files - including Cloudfront.

```ts
const policy = JSON.stringify({
  Version: '2012-10-17',
  Statement: [
    {
      Sid: 'PublicReadGetObject',
      Effect: 'Allow',
      Principal: '*',
      Action: ['s3:GetObject'],
      Resource: [`arn:aws:s3:::${bucket}/*`],
    },
  ],
});

await s3.putBucketPolicy({ Bucket: bucket, Policy: policy }).promise();
```

### Cloudfront configuration and invalidation

The last step in uploading a site for the first time to aws is configuring the Cloudfront Distribution.

This part is a bit tricky using the node.js sdk, as there is no straight-forward way to update only specific configurations on cloudfront, so first we need to load the whole configuration for the distribution, then updating the part we need:

```ts
export const configureDistribution = async (cloudfront: AWS.CloudFront, region: string, distribution: string) => {
  const config = await cloudfront.getDistribution({ Id: distribution }).promise();
  region;

  if (!config.Distribution) throw new Error('No distribution found');

  const eTag = config.ETag;
  const errorCodes = [400, 403, 404, 405, 414, 416, 500, 501, 502, 503, 504];
  const DistributionConfig = {
    ...config.Distribution?.DistributionConfig,
    CustomErrorResponses: {
      Quantity: errorCodes.length,
      Items: errorCodes.map((code) => ({
        ErrorCode: code,
        ResponsePagePath: '/404.html',
        ResponseCode: String(code),
        ErrorCachingMinTTL: 10,
      })),
    },
  };

  await cloudfront.updateDistribution({ Id: distribution, IfMatch: eTag, DistributionConfig }).promise();
};
```

The whole point of this config update is to ensure that all the error codes get redirected to our custom 404 page - since we have no server we don’t have to worry about creating a 500 page, so we can simply redirect to the same one.

This part won’t connect the distribution to the S3 bucket, that step has to be done manually - as well as setting up the index document for the distribution. There are many great tutorials on the internet about this.

We have only one step left; invalidating the distribution’s cache, so we can make sure we show up-to-date sites to our visitors.

This is relatively straight-forward, using the node.js api:

```ts
export const invalidate = async (cloudfront: AWS.CloudFront, distribution: string) => {
  const batch = { CallerReference: `${Date.now()}`, Paths: { Quantity: 1, Items: ['/*'] } };
  await cloudfront.createInvalidation({ DistributionId: distribution, InvalidationBatch: batch }).promise();
};
```

## And that’s it

We have successfully uploaded a site to AWS S3 and configured both the bucket and the cloudfront distribution.

Again, this is not for everyone but I hope I could help, even just a bit.
